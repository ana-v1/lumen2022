# Lumen Data Science 2022
Lumen in the biggest student competition in Croatia. My team **main explorers** participated in the Data Science task: GeoGuessr AI Agent. 
The agent is to be specialised for the area of mainland Croatia and tries to guess the location of the input image(s) (task linked [here](https://github.com/ana-v1/lumen2022/blob/main/lumen-datasci-2022-3.pdf)).

In this repository you can find our [project](https://github.com/ana-v1/lumen2022/blob/main/project_documentation.pdf) and [technical](https://github.com/ana-v1/lumen2022/blob/main/technical_documentation.pdf) documentation.

There were 50 teams in total and we were among one of the 7 teams selected for the Final where we presented our approach and the end solution.
As a result **my team won the 2nd place**.
