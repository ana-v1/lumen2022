# lumen2022
Lumen in the biggest student competition in Croatia. My team **main explorers** participated in the Data Science task: GeoGuessr AI Agent. 
The agent is to be specialised for the area of mainland Croatia and tries to guess the location of the input image(s) (task linked here).

In this repository you can find our project and technical documentation.

There were 50 teams in total and we were among one of the 7 teams selected for the Final where we presented our approach and the end solution.
As a result my team won the 2nd place.
